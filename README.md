## üåü Why GeoOrgan AI? (Solving Real-World, High-Impact Problems)

Most developers‚Äîeven experienced ones‚Äîstruggle with how to model, store, and query geospatial data effectively. GeoOrgan AI was created to bridge this gap by providing:
- **A real-world, high-impact use case:** We chose organ transport logistics as our example because it is life-critical, complex, and globally relevant. This scenario demonstrates the true power and necessity of geospatial modeling.
- **Practical, actionable guidance:** By using real organ donation and transport data, we show developers exactly how to model, index, and query geospatial data in MongoDB, and how to use AI to get recommendations and best practices.
- **Boosting developer productivity worldwide:** By integrating Google Maps, MongoDB Atlas, and Google Cloud AI, we make advanced geospatial modeling accessible, understandable, and actionable for any developer, anywhere.

GeoOrgan AI is not just a demo‚Äîit's a blueprint for how to build, visualize, and optimize geospatial data models for any domain, using the best of Google Cloud and MongoDB.
